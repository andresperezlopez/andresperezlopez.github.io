On 23th October 2020 I successfully defended my PhD "Parametric Analysis of Ambisonic Audio.Contributions to methods, applications and data generation", 
which was jointly supervised by Emilia Gomez (Pompeu Fabra University) and Adan Garriga (Eurecat.)
The jury consisted of Xavier Serra (Pompeu Fabra University), Maximo Cobos (University of Valencia) and Tuomas Virtanen (Tampere Univeristy).

The PhD was recogniced with the Cum Laude mention.
