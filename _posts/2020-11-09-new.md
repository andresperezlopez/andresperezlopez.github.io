My two latest works have received awards at two different conferences in Fall 2020.

- "Blind reverberation time estimation from ambisonic recordings" (A. Pérez-López, A. Politis & E. Gómez) got the _Best Paper Runner-up_ award at MMSP 2020, and

- "Papafil: A Low Complexity Sound Event Localization and Detection Method with Parametric Particle Filtering and Gradient Boosting" (A. Pérez-López &  R. Ibañez-Usach) got the _DCASE 2020 Challenge Task 3 Judges' award_.
