From November 1st to December 15th I have been visiting the [Audio Research Group at Tampere University](http://arg.cs.tut.fi/).

During the research stay I've been working under the supervision of A. Politis and T. Virtanen on the topic of auto-regressive models for multichannel late reverberation estimation.
