We are happy to announce that our paper "A HYBRID PARAMETRIC-DEEP LEARNING APPROACH FOR SOUND EVENT LOCALIZATION AND DETECTION"
by A.Pérez-López, E.Fonseca and X.Serra has been accepted for the [DCASE Workshop 2019](http://dcase.community/workshop2019/).

The paper describes the algorithm presented for the [DCASE Challenge 2019 Task 3, Sound Event Localization and Detection] (http://dcase.community/challenge2019/task-sound-event-localization-and-detection-results),
and is an extension of our previous [technical report](http://dcase.community/documents/challenge2019/technical_reports/DCASE2019_Perezlopez_106.pdf).
The algorithm code can be found at our [repository](https://github.com/andresperezlopez/DCASE2019_task3).


See you in NYC!
