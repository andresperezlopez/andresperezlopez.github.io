My first journal paper has been just published at the Journal of the Acoustic Society of America - Express Letters.
"Analysis of spherical isotropic noise fields with an A-Format tetrahedral microphone" is an outcome of my research visit
at ITE-FORTH in Heraklion, Greece during Fall 2018, and has been jointly written with N. Stefanakis.

The article is open access and can be read here: [https://asa.scitation.org/doi/figure/10.1121/1.5127736](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/figure/10.1121/1.5127736)
