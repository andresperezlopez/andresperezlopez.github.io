Our research towards a standardized, compact representation of [Impulse Responses in the Ambisonics domain](https://github.com/andresperezlopez/API_Cpp) is moving forward.

We are pleased to announce our upcoming talk *Ambisonics Directional Room Impulse Response as a New Convention of the Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics* at the [144th AES Convention](http://www.aes.org/events/144/ebriefs/?ID=6040).
