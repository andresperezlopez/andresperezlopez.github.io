We are happy to announce the release of [pysofaconventions](https://andresperezlopez.github.io/pysofaconventions/), a python implementation of the [SOFA format](www.sofaconventions.org).

SOFA (Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics) is based on [NetCDF4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF), and defines several conventions useful for storing Impulse Responses produced in different measurement scenarios.

pysofaconventions also implements our recenlty proposed [AmbisonicsDRIR convention](https://andresperezlopez.github.io/new/2018/04/11/new/).

If you want to try it, just do a `pip install pysofaconventions`!
